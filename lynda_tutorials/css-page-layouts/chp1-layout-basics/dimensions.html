			<p>Here we'll need to calculate the width of this interior div element.
				This may seem simple at first, but as we begin to add box model properties,
				and as the overall width of the parent element and the div conflict with
				one another, we'll need to understand how each of the properties combine
				to effect the overall width (and height) of page elements.
