<h1>Positioning - Fixed</h1>
<section class="container">
<p>
The box's position is calculated according to the "absolute" model, but in addition, the box is fixed with respect to some reference. As with the "absolute" model, the box's margins do not collapse with any other margins. In the case of handheld, projection, screen, tty, and tv media types, the box is fixed with respect to the viewport and does not move when scrolled. In the case of the print media type, the box is rendered on every page, and is fixed with respect to the page box, even if the page is seen through a viewport (in the case of a print-preview, for example). For other media types, the presentation is undefined. Authors may wish to specify ‘fixed’ in a media-dependent way. For instance, an author may want a box to remain at the top of the viewport on the screen, but not at the top of each printed page. The two specifications may be separated by using an ‘@media’ rule.
