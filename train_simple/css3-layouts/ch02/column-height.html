<p>Early cars had cycle wings, but these were replaced in 1933 by the full-length type that was typical of all sports MGs until the 1950s TF. The top speed of a standard car was 65 mph (105 km/h),but a specially prepared one tested by The Autocar magazine reached 82 mph (132 km/h). The car cost Â£199. There were a few serious failings of the J2, most seriously that it only had a two-bearing crank shaft which can break if over-revved.
